<span class="pagenum"><a name="page401" id="page401"></a>[pg 401]</span>

<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>


<p>We hear that the news of the defeat
of Messrs. <span class="sc">Travers</span>, <span class="sc">Evans</span> ("Chick")
and <span class="sc">Ouimet</span> in the Amateur Golf
Championship was received by President
<span class="sc">Huerta's</span> troops with round upon
round of cheering. Frankly, we think
it rather petty of them.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The statement in <i>The Daily Mail</i> to
the effect that about two million pounds
have been sunk in the new German liner
<i>Vaterland</i> is apt to be misconstrued,
and we are requested to state that the
vessel is still afloat.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>There was a fire at the Press Club
off Fleet Street last week, but we refuse
absolutely to credit the rumour that
this was the work of a member anxious
that his paper should have first news
of the conflagration.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We came across a flagrant example,
the other day, of an advertisement that
did not speak the truth. Seated on the
top of an omnibus were six persons
with most regrettable faces. Underneath
them was an inscription, which
ran the length of the knife-board:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"<span class="sc">Things we'd like to know.</span>"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Persons who are hesitating to visit
the Anglo-American Exposition may
like to know that the representation
of New York there is not so realistic
as to be unpleasant.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">A. Kipling Common</span> writes to
<i>The Daily Mail</i> deploring England's
lack of great men. We are sorry that
<i>The Times</i> should be so shy in using
its power to remedy this defect.
Letters from the great are always
printed by our contemporary in large
type. A few promotions might surely
be distributed now and then among
the small-type men?</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A friendly intimation is said to have
been conveyed by the Royal Academy
to a restaurant in the immediate neighbourhood
which advertises an Academy
luncheon that its name might with
advantage be changed to one of a nature
less inciting to Suffragettes. We refer
to <span class="sc">Hatchett's</span>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Is cannibalism to be Society's latest
fad? We notice that somebody's
Skin Food is being advertised pretty
freely.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Criterion Restaurant, we see, is
advertising a "<i>Souper Dansant</i>." Personally
we dislike the kind of supper
which, when eaten, will not lie down
and rest.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It looks, we fear, as if in <i>Break the
Walls Down</i> the Savoy Theatre has
not found a play which will <i>Bring the
House Down</i>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The proposal that a "full blue"
should be awarded at Cambridge to
those who represent the University
at boxing was recently considered but
not adopted. We should have thought
that a "black and blue" would have
been the appropriate thing.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Some idea of the heat last week may
be gathered from the following order
issued by the Cambridge University
Officers' Training Corps:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
INTER-COMPANY COMPETITION.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dress</span>:&mdash;Two pouches will be worn on the
right.
</p></blockquote>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A translation is announced of a book
by <span class="sc">August Strindberg</span>, entitled "Fair
Haven and Foul Strand." Those of us
who remember the Strand of twenty
years ago, with its mud baths, will not
consider the epithet too strong.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>There is, we hear, considerable satisfaction
among the animals at the
Zoo at the result of a recent competition
open to readers of <i>The Express</i>.
It has been decided that the ugliest
animal in the collection is the orang-utan,
who resembles a human being
more closely than any other animal.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Meanwhile it has been decided, humanely,
not to break the news to the
orang-utan himself until the weather
gets cooler.</p>

<h2>DE MORTUIS NIL NISI BONUM.</h2>

<h3><span class="sc">Lines dedicated to the outraged memory of Keats.</span></h3>

<p>[Two pretty poor sonnets by <span class="sc">Keats</span> have been exposed by a Mr.
<span class="sc">Horner</span> and exploited in facsimile, twice over in one week, by <i>The
Times</i>. In its <i>Literary Supplement</i>, where they made their second
appearance, we are told with cynical candour that "afterwards, when
he had become ashamed of his crowning" (the foolish episode which
is the subject of these two sonnets) <span class="sc">Keats</span> "kept them from publication;
and Reynolds" (the friend to whom he confided them),
"knowing the story, respected his feelings after his death."]</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>What is there in the poet's human lot</p>
<p class="i2">Most beastly loathsome? Haply you will say</p>
<p class="i2">An influenza in the prime of May?</p>
<p>Or haply, nosed in some suburban plot,</p>
<p>The reek of putrid cabbage when it's hot?</p>
<p class="i2">Or, with the game all square and one to play,</p>
<p class="i2">To be defeated by a stymie? Nay,</p>
<p>I know of something worse&mdash;I'll tell you what.</p>
<p>It is to have your rotten childish rhymes</p>
<p class="i2">(Rotten as these) dragged from oblivion's shroud</p>
<p class="i4">Where, with the silly act that gave them birth,</p>
<p class="i4">They lay as lie the dead in sacred earth,</p>
<p class="i2">And see them, twice in one week, boomed aloud</p>
<p>To tickle penny readers of <i>The Times</i>.</p>

<h2>THE AUDIT.</h2>

<p>This income of mine, in which the world has suddenly
become so interested, must be calculated from the following
returns of past years, being the figures supplied privately
to Phyllis:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">(1)                            guineas.                          &pound;</p>
<p>1911-1912.  By fees as specialist   113    By occasional papers</p>
<p class="i10">                                   in Medical Journals  35</p>
<p>1912-1913.          ditto           152             ditto         42</p>
<p>1913-1914.          ditto           203             ditto         37</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>(2) My capital is invested in Ordinary Stock, and brings
in anything from &pound;50 to &pound;100 a year, in accordance with
the varying moods of the directors.</p>

<p>(3) Lastly, I have now bought, out of my earnings, the
freehold of the premises in which I carry on my practice.
In making out a Balance Sheet this item must be regarded
either as a liability or as an asset accordingly as one takes
the dark or the bright view of the position. Either I owe
myself so much a year for rent of the premises, in which
case it is a liability: or else myself owes me so much for
rent, in which case it is an asset. Practically speaking it
doesn't much matter, because it is a bad debt either way.</p>

<p>Those amongst my (apparently) most intimate friends,
who are money-lenders, do not ask for details. They are
content to assume the worst and hope for the best. Sir
Reginald Hartley and Mr. Charles Dugmore, Assessor of
Taxes, the most interested enquirers, are not, however,
money-lenders.</p>

<p>Sir Reginald is not naturally an inquisitive man, and his
concern for me, in spite of my frequent appearance at his
table, had hitherto been limited to my services in getting
the port decanter round its circuit. It was I who, when
one evening we were doing this alone, led up to the subject.</p>

<p>"Sir Reginald," said I.</p>

<p>He passed the port again, hoping thus to damp down my
conversational powers. I, hoping to stimulate them,
helped myself.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want now, my boy?" he asked
reluctantly, noting my unsatisfied air.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I should like, Sir," said I, "and that's
a father-in-law. Would you care for the job?"</p>

<p>Not, I think, entirely with a view to what he himself was
likely to get out of this suggestion, he asked me outright
what I was worth. "I don't think," he suggested, "that
I could very well let my Phyllis marry anyone with less
than five hundred a year, eh?"</p>

<p>I got out paper and pencil, puckered up my brow, and
worked out a sum. "I am happy to announce," I said
eventually, "that we may put my income on the other side
of that figure."</p>

<p>To show my <i>bona fides</i>, I set out my sum:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>MY INCOME ('14 to '15):                                           &pound;</p>
<p class="i2">(1) <i>Fees.</i> To estimate this item it is necessary to take actual</p>
<p class="i10">   figures of last three years, which show an annual</p>
<p class="i10">   increase at the rate of about 33%. The '13 to '14</p>
<p class="i10">   figure is 203 guineas; add 33% and you get total</p>
<p class="i10">   for '14 to '15, 284 pounds, say                     300</p>
<p class="i2">(2) Add annual value of professional premises, which is         50</p>
<p class="i2">(3) <i>Occasional literature.</i> This is practically a regular</p>
<p class="i10">   stipend, at the fixed figure of (<i>circa</i>) &pound;40. But</p>
<p class="i10">   a happy marriage should promote inspiration.</p>
<p class="i10">   Allowing for same, put this figure at, say.          51</p>
<p class="i2">(4) Interest on Investments, say                               100</p>
<p class="i10">                                                     &mdash;&mdash;-</p>
<p class="i10">           <span class="sc">Grand Total.</span> (E. &amp; O. E.)                  &pound;501</p>
<p class="i10">                                                     =====</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>These, however, were not the figures I quoted to Charles
Dugmore, A.T.</p>

<p>There was no port about him, and still less did he wait
for me to introduce the subject. He sent me a sharp note
and gave me twenty-one days to answer, in default of which
he said he would have the law on me. Still, there is a certain
rough kindness even about your Assessor of Taxes; this one
enclosed a slip of paper, which he hoped I wouldn't read,
but which, when I did read it, suggested to me my middle
course of safety. "Work out your income, on lines consistent
with honesty, at less than &pound;160, and you've won,"
it said. With the assistance of the advice it gave, I had no
difficulty in doing this; thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>MY INCOME ('14 to '15):.                                                  &pound;</p>
<p class="i2">(1) <i>Trade, Vocation or Profession, A Specialist.</i> To estimate</p>
<p class="i8"> this item it is necessary to take actual figures</p>
<p class="i8"> of last three years, which show an average of</p>
<p class="i8"> 164 pounds. It is difficult to say how much of</p>
<p class="i8"> this will be net profit after making allowance</p>
<p class="i8"> for estimated rental of professional premises</p>
<p class="i8"> and other liabilities, but let us give the Inland</p>

<p class="i8"> 50% of 164 is                                                    82</p>
<p class="i2">(2) <i>Ditto, Occasional literature</i>. (This is a fluctuating</p>

<p>Ulster may fight and Mexico may be right; nevertheless
these things are apt to be forgotten when conversation
reverts, as it always does, to My Income.</p>

<p>The sordid subject came up again for discussion when
Phyllis and I went to have a preliminary chat with the
house-agent.</p>

<p>"You have spoken with eloquence and conviction about
reception-rooms, out-houses, railway stations, golf courses,
and h. and c.," said I, "but sooner or later some one must
rise and say a few pointed words about Rent."</p>

<p>"That all depends on what you are prepared to give," he
replied. "The rough-and-ready rule is to fix one's rent at
a tenth of one's income."</p>

<p>"Yes, but which income?" I asked. "For I have two
incomes and I can't afford a separate house for each."</p>

<p>He had no formula for my case and I left him a little
later under a cloud of suspicion. Your house-agent is an
ill judge of the subtler forms of humour.</p>

<h2>THE COLONEL TALKS.</h2>

<p>The great hunter and explorer received
us with profound affability.
Thinner he may be, but his terrible
privations in the perilous back blocks
of Brazil have left his dazzling bonzoline
smile unharmed. Every one of
the powerful two-and-thirty extended a
separate welcome.</p>

<p>"Sit right down," he said.</p>

<p>We sat right down.</p>

<p>"Say, Colonel," we began in the
vernacular, "tell us about the river.
Some river, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"You are right, Sir," he replied.
"It's a river. The Thames, according
to your great statesman, Colonel <span class="sc">Burns</span>,
is 'liquid history;' my river is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"According to <span class="sc">Savage Landor</span>," we
interrupted, "'liquid mystery.'"</p>

<p>The explorer's face fell. "I will deal
with him later," he said. "Meanwhile
let me tell you, Sir, that this is no
slouch of a river. It has all the necessary
ingredients of a river. It has
banks, and a current. There are fish in
it. Boats and canoes can progress on
its surface. Twenty-three times did I
risk my valuable life in saving boats
and canoes that had got adrift. It has
rapids. Twenty-eight times did I nearly
drown in negotiating them. It has
some ugly snags. The ugliest I have
called 'Wilson,' the next ugliest,
'Bryan.'"</p>

<p>He stopped for applause and we let
him have it.</p>

<p>"It was a great discovery of yours,"
we said, after he had bowed several
times.</p>

<p>"No, Sir," he replied, "let us get
that right. It is not my discovery. It
is the discovery of Colonel <span class="sc">Rondor</span>."</p>

<p>"Well, you keep it among the
colonels anyway," we said.</p>

<p>"In America, Sir," replied the modern
Columbus&mdash;"in G. O. C., by which I
mean God's Own Country&mdash;we keep
everything among the colonels. But
to proceed&mdash;it is not my discovery.
All that I did was to trace it to its
source in order to put it on the map.
That is my ambition&mdash;the crowning
moment of my <i>ex-officio</i> life&mdash;to put
this river on the map. It will mean a
boom in South America at last. They
are all out-of-date and new ones must
be made."</p>

<p>"And what will you call the river?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"I am not sure," he said. "Some
want it to be known as the 'Roosevelt,'
but that does not please me. The
'Rondor' would be better, or 'The
Two Colonels.' Can you suggest anything?"</p>

<p>"Why not 'The Sixty-five'?" we
said, "since you lost sixty-five pounds
in your travels."</p>

<p>"Good," he said. "I will put the
point to Kermet."</p>

<p>"And is that your only triumph," we
asked&mdash;"the river?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he said. "There is a bird
too. A new bird, about the size of a
turkey."</p>

<p>"Turkey in Europe or Turkey in
Asia?" we asked.</p>

<p>He pulled a gun from his belt and
stroked it lovingly. There are moments
when even an interviewer' recognises
the dangers of importunity, and this
was one.</p>

<h2>ONE OF OUR GREATEST.</h2>

<h3><span class="sc">An Interview</span>.</h3>

<p>It was naturally not without difficulty
that I won my way to the presence
of so busy and influential a publicist.
A man who spends his whole time in
instructing the readers of so many
different papers in the delicate art of
discerning the best and ignoring the
rest cannot have much margin for inquisitive
strangers.</p>

<p>However, I succeeded in penetrating
to his sanctum and, while waiting for
the lion to appear, had an opportunity
to look round. It was severely furnished&mdash;obviously
the room of a great
thinker. I noticed on the desk, which
was covered with paper and note-books, a
copy of <span class="sc">Roget's</span> <i>Thesaurus</i> and <span class="sc">Taylor's</span>
<i>Natural History of Enthusiasm</i>. With
two such works one can, of
course, go far. On the wall
were the mottoes, "We
needs must love the highest
when we see it," and
(from <i>The Bellman</i>) "What
I tell you three times is
true." I noticed two portraits
also: one was of a
delightful grande dame who
might have graced a pavane
in the days of <span class="sc">Louis Quinze</span>,
inscribed to her "fellow-worker
in the great cause,
from Madame de <span class="sc">Boccage</span>,"
and another was the photograph
of a gay young
Frenchman in English
clothes, signed "To mon
cher colleague from 'is sincere
friend Alphonse."
There were also three telephones
on the table and several typewriters
here and there.</p>

<p>A moment later the wizard came in&mdash;a
tall scholarly-looking figure, with
all the stigmata of the great thinker
beneath one of the highest brows in
Europe.</p>

<p>"And what," he asked, bowing with
perfect courtesy, "can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"I have come hoping for the privilege
of an interview," I said.</p>

<p>"But why," he replied with charming
diffidence, "should you interview
me? Why am I thus honoured?"</p>

<p>"Because you are a very remarkable
person," I replied. "You are the only
journalist who can contribute the same
articles regularly to <i>The Pall Mall</i>,
<i>The Westminster</i> and I don't know to
how many other papers besides. That
is a feat in itself. You are the only
journalist who always has the same
subject."</p>

<p>He admitted these fine performances.</p>

<p>"So I should like to ask you a few
questions," I continued. "The public
is naturally interested in the personality
of so widely read an author. May
I know how you obtained your amazing
command of words? Your fluency?"</p>

<p>"I have ever made a study of the
finest writers," he said. "From <span class="sc">Moses</span>
to <span class="sc">De Courville</span>, I have read them
all. These studies and constant intercourse
with the brainiest Americans I
can meet have made me what I am."</p>

<p>"But your certainty in discrimination,"
I said&mdash;"how did you acquire
that? Most of us are so doubtful of
ourselves."</p>

<p>"I never am," he replied; "I am
sure. One thing at a time is my theory.
Concentrate on one thing and forget
all the rest. In other words, trust to
elimination. That's what I do. Having
found something that I know to be
good I instantly eliminate all thought
of the existence of rival claimants and
concentrate on that discovery and its
exploitation."</p>

<p>"Marvellous," I murmured. "And
how do you think of all your variations
on the one stimulating theme?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, "that is my secret."
He tapped his massive forehead. "It
wants a bit of doing, but I think I may
say that up to date I have delivered
the goods."</p>

<p>"You may," I said. "Have you no
assistants?"</p>

<p>He flushed angrily and I changed
the subject.</p>

<p>"In your spare time&mdash;&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"I have none," he said. "I want
none."</p>

<p>"But surely now and then," I urged,
"after office hours?"</p>

<p>"I never relax," he said. "If I am
not writing I am worshipping. I walk
up and down on the other side of the
street, gazing this way, wondering and
adoring."</p>

<p>What a man!</p>

<p>"Now and then," I said, "you puzzle
me a little. The columns in the evening
papers go fairly straight to the
point, but you are not always so direct.
One now and then has to search for
the true purpose of the article."</p>

<p>He bent his fine brows in perplexity.</p>

<p>"As when?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "those third leaders
in <i>The Times</i>, for example. I often
read them without making perfectly
sure which department of the great
House you are recommending: to which
of its varied activities you are drawing
particular attention."</p>

<p>He looked more bewildered. "The
third leaders in <i>The Times</i>?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "Don't you write
those?"</p>

<p>"No," he replied with emphasis.</p>

<p>"Great Heavens!" I said, "I'm
very sorry if I've hurt you.
But I always assumed that
you did."</p>

<p>The simultaneous ringing
of the three telephones
warned me that my
time was up and I rose to
go.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," he said,
"Good-bye. You know
where to go if you want
anything, don't you? No
matter what it is&mdash;ties,
socks, dress&mdash;suits, scent,
afternoon tea, civility, perfection.
You know where
to go?"&mdash;and he bowed me
out.</p>

<p>And that is how I met
Callisthenes.</p>

<h2>BLUDYARD.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. Rudyard Kipling's</span> few remarks,
made beneath the blue sky of the
Empire at Tunbridge Wells, have not
yet lost their effect. The famous
orator's letter-bag is daily crowded
with communications from total
strangers who have striven in vain to
resist the impulse to tell him what
they think of him and his speech.</p>

<p>"I understand from the local paper
that you're an author," writes one
correspondent from Haggerston; "if
you can write like you can speak,
your books ought to sell in hundreds."</p>

<p>"Your speech was quite good," writes
another, "so far as it went; the only
fault I have to find with it is that it
was not strong enough, Sir, not strong
enough. The blackguards!"</p>

<p>An envelope of pale purple, gently
perfumed, contained that well-known
work (now in its tenth thousand),
"Gentle Words, and How to Use
Them. By Amelia Papp." We understand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page407" id="page407"></a>[pg 407]</span>
that the receipt of this famous
pamphlet had a tremendous effect upon
Mr. <span class="sc">Kipling</span>.</p>

<p>The speech has put courage into the
heart of a young literary man known
to us. "I have long yearned to break
away from the weaklings who can do
no more than call a spade a spade," he
said the other day. "I feel that I
now have a master's authority for
doing so. In gratitude I can do no
less than send Mr. <span class="sc">Kipling</span> a copy of
my new book, <i>The Seven D's</i>, when
it is ready."</p>

<p>"I cannot be too grateful for your
impressive speech," wrote a lady from
Balham. "For many weeks now
I consider that my butcher has been
sending joints that are perfectly disgraceful,
and I have been quite at a loss
to know how to deal with him. But
thanks to your great utterance I was
able to get together just the words I
wanted, and on Tuesday last I sent
him <i>such</i> a letter. You will be glad to
know that Wednesday's shoulder was
excellent."</p>

<p>An anonymous correspondent, dating
from a temporary address at Limehouse,
has written, "Why don't you
come over on our side? You and I
together could do great things."</p>

<span class="sc">According to a scheme suggested by the Royal Statistical Society
everyone should be given a number and an index card at his birth. This
would help the police to trace missing persons, prevent fraudulent
marriages, etc. it would brighten the scheme if everybody was compelled
to wear his number in a conspicuous position, and if a descriptive
catalogue was issued</span>.</p></div>

<h2>A HANGING GARDEN IN BABYLON.</h2>

<p>"Are you taking me to the Flower
Show this afternoon?" asked Celia at
breakfast.</p>

<p>"No," I said thoughtfully; "no."</p>

<p>"Well, that's that. What other
breakfast conversation have I? Have
you been to any theatres lately?"</p>

<p>"Do you really want to go to the
Flower Show?" I asked. "Because I
don't believe I could bear it."</p>

<p>"I've saved up two shillings."</p>

<p>"It isn't that&mdash;not only that. But
there'll be thousands of people there,
all with gardens of their own, all pointing
to things and saying, 'We've got
one of those in the east bed,' or
'Wouldn't that look nice in the south
orchid house?' and you and I will be
quite, quite out of it." I sighed, and
helped myself from the west toast-rack.</p>

<p>It is very delightful to have a flat in
London, but there are times in the
summer when I long for a garden of
my own. I show people round our
little place, and I point out hopefully
the Hot Tap Doultonii in the bathroom,
and the Dorothy Perkins loofah,
but it isn't the same thing as taking
your guest round your garden and telling
him that what you really want is
rain. Until I can do that the Chelsea
Flower Show is no place for us.</p>

<p>"Then I haven't told you the good
news," said Celia. "We <i>are</i> gardeners."
She paused a moment for effect. "I
have ordered a window-box."</p>

<p>I dropped the marmalade and jumped
up eagerly.</p>

<p>"Celia, my child," I cried, "this is
glorious news! I haven't been so
excited since I recognised a calceolaria
last year, and told my host it was a
calceolaria just before he told me.
A window-box! What's in it?"</p>

<p>"Pink geraniums and&mdash;and pink
geraniums and&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pink geraniums?" I suggested.</p>

<p>"Yes. They're very pretty, you
know."</p>

<p>"I know. But I could have wished
for something more difficult. If we
had something like&mdash;well, I don't want
to seem to harp on it, but say calceolarias,
then quite a lot of people
mightn't recognise them, and I should
be able to tell them what they were.
I should be able to show them the
calceolarias; you can't show people
the geraniums."</p>

<p>"You can say, 'What do you think
of <i>that</i> for a geranium?'" said Celia.
"Anyhow," she added, "you've got to
take me to the Flower Show now."</p>

<p>"Of course I will. It is not only a
pleasure, but a duty. As gardeners
we must keep up with floricultural
progress. Even though we start with
pink geraniums now, we may have&mdash;er,
calceolarias next year. Rotation
of crops and&mdash;and what not."</p>

<p>Accordingly we made our way in
the afternoon to the Show.</p>

<p>"I think we're a little over-dressed,"
I said as we paid our shillings. "We
ought to look as if we'd just run up
from our little window-box in the
country and were going back by the
last train. I should be in gaiters,
really."</p>

<p>"Our little window-box is not in the
country," objected Celia. "It's what
you might call a&mdash;a <i>pied de terre</i> in
town. French joke," she added kindly.
"Much more difficult than the ordinary
sort."</p>

<p>"Don't forget it; we can always use
it again on visitors. Now what shall
we look at first?"</p>

<p>"The flowers first; then the tea."</p>

<p>I had bought a catalogue and was
scanning it rapidly.</p>

<p>"We don't want flowers," I said.
"Our window-box&mdash;our garden is
already full. It may be that James,
the head boxer, has overdone the pink
geraniums this year, but there it is.
We can sack him and promote Thomas,
but the mischief is done. Luckily there
are other things we want. What about
a dove-cot? I should like to see doves
cooing round our geraniums."</p>

<p>"Aren't dove-cots very big for a
window-box?"</p>

<p>"We could get a small one&mdash;for small
doves. Do you have to buy the doves
too, or do they just come? I never
know. Or there," I broke off suddenly;
"my dear, that's just the thing." And
I pointed with my stick.</p>

<p>"We have seven clocks already,"
said Celia.</p>

<p>"But a sun-dial! How romantic.
Particularly as only two of the clocks
go. Celia, if you'd let me have a sundial
in my window-box, I would meet
you by it alone sometimes."</p>

<p>"It sounds lovely," she said doubtfully.</p>

<p>"You do want to make this window-box
a success, don't you?" I asked as
we wandered on. "Well, then, help
me to buy something for it. I don't
suggest one of those," and I pointed to
a summer-house, "or even a weather-cock;
but we must do something now
we're here. For instance, what about
one of these patent extension ladders, in
case the geraniums grow very tall and
you want to climb up and smell them?
Or would you rather have some mushroom
spawn? I would get up early
and pick the mushrooms for breakfast.
What do you think?"</p>

<p>"I think it's too hot for anything,
and I must sit down. Is this seat an
exhibit or is it meant for sitting on?"</p>

<p>"It's an exhibit, but we might easily
want to buy one some day, when our
window-box gets bigger. Let's try it."</p>

<p>It was so hot that I think, if the man
in charge of the Rustic Bench Section
had tried to move us on, we should
have bought the seat at once. But
nobody bothered us. Indeed it was
quite obvious that the news that we
owned a large window-box had not yet
got about.</p>

<p>"I shall leave you here," I said after
I had smoked a cigarette and dipped
into the catalogue again, "and make
my purchase. It will be quite inexpensive;
indeed, it is marked in the
catalogue at one-and-sixpence, which
means that they will probably offer me
the nine-shilling size first. But I shall
be firm. Good-bye."</p>

<p>I went and bought one and returned
to her with it.</p>

<p>"No, not now," I said, as she held
out her hand eagerly. "Wait till we
get home."</p>

<p>It was cooler now, and we wandered
through the tents, chatting patronisingly
to the stall-keeper whenever we
came to pink geraniums. At the
orchids we were contemptuously sniffy.
"Of course," I said, "for those who
<i>like</i> orchids&mdash;&mdash;" and led the way back
to the geraniums again. It was an
interesting afternoon.</p>

<p>And to our great joy the window-box
was in position when we got home
again.</p>

<p>"Now!" I said dramatically, and I
unwrapped my purchase and placed it
in the middle of our new-made garden.</p>

<p>"Whatever&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A slug-trap," I explained proudly.</p>

<p>"But how could slugs get up here?"
asked Celia in surprise.</p>

<p>"How do slugs got anywhere? They
climb up the walls, or they come up in
the lift, or they get blown about by the
wind&mdash;I don't know. They can fly up
if they like; but, however it be, when
they do come, I mean to be ready for
them."</p>

<p>Still, though our slug-trap will no
doubt come in usefully, it is not what
we really want. What we gardeners
really want is rain.</p>

<h2>DRASTIC REFORM OF SCHOOLS.</h2>

<h3><span class="sc">Remarkable Speech</span>.</h3>

<p>Owing to the ruthless condensation
of the Parliamentary Reports in the
daily Press, no mention was made of
Mr. Alfred Dunstanley's motion last
Thursday, under the ten-minutes rule,
for leave to bring in his Bill for the
Reform of Public Schools. That omission
we are now able to make good,
thanks to the enterprise of a correspondent
who was present during the
debate in the Strangers' Gallery.</p>

<p>Mr. Dunstanley remarked that he
was not prompted by any animosity
to our public schools and did not
propose to exterminate or annihilate
them. But he was convinced that in
the best interests of the nation they
ought to be purged of the excrescences
and anomalies which militated against
their utility. The Bill accordingly provided
that, pending the extinction of
the hereditary peerage, peers or peers'
sons, if they insisted on going to
public schools, should be carefully
segregated and kept in a state of
perpetual coventry. It was not advisable
that the healthy sons of our
democracy should associate with those
effete and tainted aristocrats. The
Bill stopped short of sending them to
the lethal chamber, but recommended
that they should pay triple fees.</p>

<p>Mr. Dunstanley explained that he
had no feeling against titled persons
as individuals. But the facts were
against them. Thus the word viscount
was in Latin vice-comes, in itself a
terrible admission. Again, baronets
were almost invariably depicted in
lurid colours by the best novelists.
In short their presence at our public
schools could not be safely tolerated,
as even the children of good Radicals
were not immune to the danger of
snobbery and sycophancy. The Bill
also provided for compulsory vegetarian
diet and the abolition of all cadet
corps, rifle-shooting and caning.</p>

<p>Mr. Dunstanley concluded by observing
that it pained him to bring forward
this motion, as he had many friends who
had been born in the purple, and some
had survived the demoralising influences
involved in their birth, but he felt it
his solemn duty to lodge a practical
protest against the fetish worship of
rank and wealth and war, which, in
the opinion of his great-headed colleague,
Mr. <span class="sc">John Ward</span>, was ruining
the country.</p>

<hr />

<p>From a letter to <i>The Accrington
Gazette</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"I do hope that the Accrington Town
Council will read, mark, learn this epistle and
lay these precepts to their hearts, which in
Latin I will quote: 'Quod Hoc Sibi Vult.'
It means that the exposed food stuffs will not
only be impregnated with the volcanic like
dust representing the cremated remnant of
the town's horrible organic refuse, but will
also be tainted with the smell that tastes."
</p></blockquote>

would have pleased our old Sixth Form
Master, who was always complaining
that our translations did not bring out

<p>I said, "Within the garden trimly bordered,</p>

<p>The Heavenly Nine, by young Apollo wardered,"</p>
<p class="i2">And Araminta answered, "Yes, dear, do.</p>
<p>The deck chair's in the outhouse; lunch is ordered</p>
<p class="i6">For twenty-five to two."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I sat within the garden's island summer</p>
<p class="i2">And heard far off the shunting of the trains,</p>
<p>Noises of wheels, and speech of every comer</p>
<p class="i2">Passing the entrance&mdash;heard the man of brains</p>
<p>Talking of <span class="sc">George's</span> Budget, heard the plumber</p>
<p class="i6">Planning new leaks for drains.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>These things did not disturb me. Through the fencing</p>
<p class="i2">I liked to bear in mind that men less free</p>
<p>Must toil and tramp, whilst I was just commencing</p>
<p class="i2">To court the Muses, foolscap on my knee,</p>
<p>Helped by the sweet bird in the shade-dispensing</p>
<p class="i6">Something-or-other tree.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I wrote: "Ah, who would be where rough men jostle</p>
<p class="i2">In dust and grime, like porkers at a trough.</p>
<p>When, here is May and May-time's blest apostle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p class="i2">Just then, without preliminary cough,</p>
<p>Suddenly, ere I knew, the actual throstle,</p>
<p class="i6">Tee'd up and started off.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>It drowned the distant noise of motor-'buses,</p>
<p class="i2">It drowned the shunting trains, the traffic's roar,</p>
<p>The milk, the bread, the meat, the tradesmen's fusses,</p>
<p class="i2">And the long secret tale told o'er and o'er</p>
<p>That all day long Eliza Jane discusses</p>
<p class="i6">With the new girl next door.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>So sweetly the bird sang. Great thrills went through it.</p>
<p class="i2">It seemed to say, "The glorious sun hath shone,</p>

<p class="i2">Why should we harp of age and dull years gone?"</p>
<p>Time seemed to be no sort of object to it&mdash;</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="sc">Extracted from the Diary of Toby, M.P.</span>)</h3>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, May 18.</i>&mdash;Field-Marshal
<span class="sc">Asquith</span>, on military
duty in attendance on the <span class="sc">King</span> at
Aldershot. Takes opportunity to give
<span class="sc">His Majesty</span> a few hints on the
setting of a squadron in the field. In
his absence depression customary on
reassembling after week-end recess
asserts itself with increased force.
Through early portion of Question-hour
benches half empty. As hands of
clock approached the mark 2.45, stream
of arrivals increased in volume. At conclusion
of Questions House so densely
crowded that side galleries were invaded,
and group of Members stood at
Bar.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:40%;"><a href="images/413a.png"><img width="100%" src="images/413a.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="sc">Mr. Lloyd George and the Welsh
Disestablishment Bill.</span></p>

<p>"For the rest it was the same grinding out
of barrel-organ tunes that has been going on
these three years."</p></div>

<p>Strangers in Gallery rubbed their
eyes and asked what this might portend?
Explanation simple. Within
limit of Question-hour no division may
take place. As soon as boundary passed
danger zone for Ministerialists entered.
Last week Opposition snapped a division
at earliest possible moment and nearly
cornered Government. To-day at least
two divisions on Welsh Church Bill
imminent. Ministerialists, obedient to
urgent Whip, in their places in good
time. When divisions were called&mdash;one
on report of financial resolution of
Welsh Church Bill, the other closing
Committee stage&mdash;298 voted with
Government against 204 for rejection
of motion. By rare coincidence figures
in both divisions were exactly the same,
re-establishing Government majority at
94.</p>

<p>This done, Members trooped out in
battalions, leaving <span class="sc">Hume Williams</span> to
spend on wooden intelligence of
empty benches able argument
in support of motion
for rejection of Bill at Third
Reading stage. Lifeless debate
temporarily uplifted by
speech of simple eloquence
from <span class="sc">William Jones</span>, who,
after long interval, breaks
the silence imposed upon a
Whip. Quickly gathering
audience listened from both
sides with obvious pleasure
to a speech which, as
<span class="sc">Stuart-Wortley</span> said, was
"marked by real fervour
and manifest sincerity."
We have not so many
natural orators in present
House that we can with
indifference see given up
to the drudgery of the
Whips' room what was
meant for mankind.</p>

<p>One passage, a sort of
aside, brought tears to eyes
of case-hardened section of the audience
seated in Press Gallery. They
furtively dropped when Member for
Carnarvon described how, a small
boy visiting the Strangers' Gallery, he
found seated there "a saintly Pressman,
a frail and fragile figure in bad health,
who wrote weekly letters to the Welsh
<i>Baner</i>. I saw him," he added, "at
lucid intervals, writing his letters."</p>

<p>House loudly laughed at picture thus
graphically drawn. Pressmen, not
essentially saintly, know how desirable
is the accessory of lucid intervals for
the writing of London Letters.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Under Procedure
Resolution agreed to last week Welsh
Church Disestablishment Bill carried
through Committee as quickly as Chairman
could put formal motion. Debate
opened on Third Reading.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;"I rejoice," said <span class="sc">F. E.
Smith</span>, rising at ten o'clock in half
empty House to support motion for
rejection of Welsh Church Bill on
Third Reading stage, "that debates on
this measure are approaching termination.
We are all driven to make the
same speeches over again and to cite
old illustrations of the insane constitution
under which we live."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:40%;"><a href="images/413b.png"><img width="100%" src="images/413b.png" alt=""/></a><p>A PASSIVE RESISTER.</p>

<p>"Let degenerate Irishmen, suborned by bargain with a Saxon Government,
go forth to save it in the Division Lobby."</p>

<p>(Mr. <span class="sc">William O'Brien.</span>)</p></div>

<p>This frank admission of the inutility
of stretching debate over two sittings
not agreeable to feelings of those responsible
for weary waste of time. All
the same, lamentably true.</p>

<p>Only impulse of vitality given to proceedings
came from speech of <span class="sc">George
Cave</span>. Member for Kingston does not
frequently interpose in debate. Long
intervals of silence give him opportunity
of garnering something worth saying,
a rule of Parliamentary life that might
be recommended to the attention of
some who shall here be nameless. For
the rest it was the same grinding out
of barrel-organ tunes in varied keys
that has been going on these three
years. <span class="sc">McKenna</span> gave touch of originality
to his remarks in winding up
debate by avoiding reference to the late
<span class="sc">Giraldus Cambrensis</span>. Thus momentarily
refreshed, Members gratefully went
out to Division Lobby, and Third Reading
was carried by majority of 77.</p>

<p>In two other divisions concerning
Welsh Church Bill taken yesterday,
what the late Mr. <span class="sc">G. P. R. James</span> if he
were starting a new novel would describe
as a solitary figure&mdash;"a
solitary horseman" was,
to be precise, the consecrated
phrase&mdash;might have been
observed sitting in corner
seat below Gangway on
Opposition side. It was
<span class="sc">William O'Brien</span> assuming
the attitude of passive resister
to a measure which,
in respect of an established
Church that national feeling
regards as alien, proposes to
do for Wales what nearly
half a century ago <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>
did for Ireland. In
Parliamentary parlance,
"the hon. Member in
possession of the House" is
the gentleman on his legs
addressing the <span class="sc">Speaker</span>.
Whilst a crowd of Members
streamed out, some into the
"Aye" Lobby, others into
the "No," <span class="sc">William O'Brien</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page414" id="page414"></a>[pg 414]</span>
remained seated, for a moment or two
literally the Member in possession of
the House.</p>

<p>Let degenerate Irishmen, suborned
by bargain with a Saxon Government,
go forth to save it in the Division
Lobby. Sea-green (with envy of <span class="sc">John
Redmond</span>, whose name will, after all,
be imperishably connected with the
final success of a National movement
inaugurated forty years ago by <span class="sc">Isaac
Butt</span>) incorruptible, <span class="sc">William O'Brien</span>
thus protested against a course of events
he has been unable to control. To those
who remember his fierce eloquence in
past years dominating a hostile audience
there was something pathetic in
the spectacle.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Welsh Church
Disestablishment Bill read third
time. Sent on to meet predestined
fate in Lords.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Quite lively goings
on. House met to open debate
on Third Reading of Home Rule
Bill, at special desire of Opposition
to be extended over three
sittings. <span class="sc">Campbell</span> had given
notice of intention to move
rejection. Everything pointed to
long dreary evening, the serving-up
of that "thrice boiled cole-wort"
which <span class="sc">Carlyle</span> honestly
believed to form the principal
dish in the House of Commons
shilling dinner.</p>

<p>Expected that <span class="sc">Premier</span> would
indicate purport and scope of
promised Bill amending an Act
not yet added to Statute Book.
Questioned on subject he announced
that Bill will be introduced
in the Lords. Judged by
ordinary business tactics this
seemed a reasonable arrangement.
On return from Whitsun
holidays the Lords will find
Home Rule Bill at their disposal.
Do not conceal intention of
throwing it out on Second Reading.
Whereupon, Parliament Act stepping
in, it will be added to Statute Book.
Meanwhile Lords, having no other
business on hand, might devote their
time to consideration of that settlement
of Ulster question which all parties
speak of as their heart's desire.</p>

<p>House of Commons is, however,
above consideration of ordinary business
ways. Announcement of Ministerial
intention with respect to Amending
Bill raised clamour worthy of
our best traditions. Poor <span class="sc">Campbell</span>
getting up to perform appointed task
was greeted by his own friends with
stormy cries for adjournment. For full
five minutes he stood at Table, with
nervous fingers rapping a tune on lid
of brass-bound box.</p>

<p>"What's he playing, do you think?"
<span class="sc">Winterton</span> asked <span class="sc">Rowland Hunt</span>.</p>

<p>"As far as I can make out," said
the Man for Shropshire, "it's 'The
Campbells are Coming.'"</p>

<p>"By Jove, they shan't come," said
<span class="sc">Winterton</span>, who was in his element
(hot water). "'Journ! 'Journ! Journ!"
he shouted, leading again the storm of
interruption that prevented a word
being heard from <span class="sc">Campbell</span>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Speaker</span> at end of five minutes asked
<span class="sc">Bonner Law</span> whether this refusal of
the Opposition to hear one of their
leaders met with his assent and approval?
<span class="sc">Bonner Law</span> haughtily refused
to answer. <span class="sc">Winterton</span> and
<span class="sc">Kinloch Cooke</span> more delighted than
ever. Uproar growing, the <span class="sc">Speaker</span>
declared sitting suspended and left the
Chair.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:40%;"><a href="images/414.png"><img width="100%" src="images/414.png" alt=""/></a><p>"MORITHURI TE SALUTHAMUS."</p>

<p>"In regard to the Home Rule Bill, the position of himself
and his friends was, 'We who are about to die salute
thee.'"&mdash;<i><span class="sc">Mr. Tim Healy</span></i>.</p></div>

<p>A critical moment. So high did angry
passion run that there might have
been repetition of the famous fisticuffs
on floor of House that marked progress
of first Home Rule Bill. Ominous
sign when <span class="sc">Royds</span> of Sleaford, ordinarily
mildest-mannered of men, rushed between
Front Opposition Bench and
Table and shook a minatory forefinger
at <span class="sc">Asquith</span>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Premier</span> only smiled. Happily his
indifferent good humour prevailed on
his own side. There was interchange
of acrid compliments as parties joined
each other on the way out. But
nothing more happened, except that
<span class="sc">Hasleton</span> and another Irish Nationalist,
passing empty chair of <span class="sc">Sergeant-at-Arms</span>,
lit, the one a pipe, the other
a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Shocking!" cried an outraged
Member of the old school.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said <span class="sc">Sark</span>. "When
the House of Commons is enlivened by
pot-house manners there is surely no
harm in two customers lighting up as
they pass out."</p>

<p><i>Business.</i>&mdash;Outbreak of disorder,
<span class="sc">Speaker</span> suspends sitting.</p>

<h2>BUYING A PIANO.</h2>

<p>I had often thought I should
like to possess a really good
piano&mdash;not one of those dumpy
vertical instruments, but a big
flat one with a long tail. For
a long time I hesitated between
a Rolls Royce, a Yost, a Veuve
Cliquot, and a Thurston. At
last I put the problem to a
musical friend. He said:</p>

<p>"It's a piano you want, not
a motor-typewriting-champagne-table?
Very good, then. You go
to Steinbech's in Wigram Street.
They'll fix you up. Mention my
name if you like."</p>

<p>"What'll happen to me if I
do?"</p>

<p>"They'll sell you a piano.
That's what you want, isn't it?"</p>

<p>So I went. I told the man
at Steinbech's that I believed
they sold pianos. He said that
my belief was not without foundation,
but that, in any case, they
would be prepared to stretch a
point in my favour and sell me
one. What sort did I require?</p>

<p>"A big flat one with a long
tail," I replied.</p>

<p>"Ah, you want a full concert-grand?
Then kindly step into our
show-room, Sir. Now, this one," he
said, indicating a handsome brunette,
"is a magnificent piano. Best workmanship
and superior materials employed
throughout. Splendid tone and
light touch. Price, one hundred guineas.
Examine it; try it for yourself, Sir."
And he opened the keyboard as he
spoke.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;what order are the notes
arranged in?" I asked.</p>

<p>"In strict alphabetical order," he
answered. "A, B, C, and so on."</p>

<p>"You must excuse my asking the
question," I went on, "but the fact is
I've never seen a Steinbech before. I
thought perhaps that different makers
adopted different arrangements of the
notes, as makers of typewriters do.
Now, will this piano play <span class="sc">Beethoven</span>?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page415" id="page415"></a>[pg 415]</span>
I particularly want a piano that will play
the 'Moonlight' and the 'Waldstein.'"</p>

<p>"You're not thinking of a <i>pianola</i>,
Sir, are you?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied, "I am not. I have
no sympathy with music that looks
like a Gruy&egrave;re cheese. The music I
want my piano to play is the ordinary
printed kind&mdash;black-currants and stalks
and that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"Well, Sir, you will find that this
piano is specially adapted for playing
all kinds of printed music. Music in
manuscript may also be rendered upon
it."</p>

<p>"That's one point settled then," I
said. "Now, if you will kindly prize
the lid off, I should like to look at the
works."</p>

<p>He lifted the lid and propped it up
with a short billiard-cue which fitted
into a notch. All danger of sudden
decapitation having been removed, I
put my head inside.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" I cried. "What's this
harp doing in here? Doesn't it get in
the way?"</p>

<p>"That is not a harp, Sir; that is
part of the mechanism&mdash;the wires, you
know."</p>

<p>I plucked a few of them, and they
gave forth a pleasing sound. So I
plucked some more.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said decidedly, "I like
the rigging very much. And now
perhaps you will be good enough to
tell me what those two foot-clutches
are for, which I noticed underneath
the keyboard. I suppose they are the
brake and the reversing-gear?"</p>

<p>I was wrong. The man expounded
their true functions to me. Then I
said, "I should just like to examine it
underneath, if you wouldn't mind turning
it on its back."</p>

<p>The fellow told me that it was
unnecessary and unusual&mdash;that I had
seen all there was to see. This made
me suspicious. I was certain he was
trying to conceal some radical defect
from me. So I made up my mind to
see for myself. I took off my coat and
crawled underneath. As I suspected,
I found two large round holes in the
flooring. When I had finished rubbing
my head, I drew the man's attention
to them. He was able to give a more
or less reasonable excuse for them. I
forget what he said they were&mdash;ventilators,
I think.</p>

<p>He concluded by saying that the
instrument would be certain to give
me the utmost satisfaction.</p>

<p>"You would not recommend my
having a more expensive one?" I
asked. "A Stradivarius, or a Benvenuto
Cellini?"</p>

<p>He thought not; so we clinched the
deal.</p>

<p>"I think," I said, as I handed him
my cheque, "that I should like my
name-plate fixed on it somewhere&mdash;say,
on one of the end notes that I
shall never use."</p>

<p>But he advised me against this.
None of the players handicapped at
scratch ever thought of such a thing.</p>

<p>"Very well," I said. "Just wrap it
up for me, and I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better send it for you,"
he suggested, "in one of our vans, in
charge of our own men?"</p>

<p>"Just so," I agreed. "Good morning."</p>

<p>The piano duly arrived, and when we
had taken the drawing-room door out
of its socket and demolished a large
portion of two walls, they got it in&mdash;just
in. With care I can squeeze into
the room. However, I am happy,
though crowded, for I have achieved
my heart's desire.</p>

<p>It has been with me a year now. I
must soon think of learning to play it.</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<h3><span class="sc">"The Great Gamble."</span></h3>

<p>A man who elopes with his friend's wife
cannot fairly expect to command general
sympathy when, sooner or later, he has
to pay the claims of offended morality.
Yet one could not help being a little
sorry for <i>Colonel Herrick</i>, the leading
delinquent in Mr. <span class="sc">Jerome's</span> play. For
scarcely had they started for the Continent
from Charing Cross (to be precise,
the train was passing through Chislehurst)
when the lady suddenly repented
of her rash act and burst into unassuageable
tears. If, on reaching Dover,
he had had the happy thought of
despatching her back to her home as
unaccompanied baggage, he
would have saved himself a
vast deal of trouble. But,
being a soldier, he set his
teeth and went forward, and
for eight days she made the
hotels of Europe ring with
her lamentations. Nor was
this his only source of discomfort.
Though, for convenience,
they appeared in the
visitors' books as man and
wife, the lady's attitude compelled
the maintenance of
platonic relations, and, whereas
in actual life this would
merely have meant that he
had to occupy a separate
bedroom, in Mr. <span class="sc">Jerome's</span>
vision of things as they might
be it meant that he had to
sleep in the bath-room.</p>

<p>It will be readily understood
that, to <i>The Colonel</i>,
the advent of the infuriated
husband was of the nature
of a relief. Thanks to the
intervention of a large assortment
of friends, and after
assurance given of the lady's technical
retention of her virtue, he agrees to
take her back if she cares to rejoin
him. It is true that before the happy
conclusion, so satisfactory to <i>The
Colonel</i>, is reached, a duel <i>manqu&eacute;</i> is
interposed; but this is designed for the
sole benefit of the audience and does
not affect the result.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the lady adopts an
enigmatic behaviour. On the appearance
of her husband she exchanges the
black dress of remorse for the gay
yellow garb of a mind at ease; yet
under his very nose she permits herself
to exhibit a very intimate delight
in <i>The Colonel's</i> more obvious attractions.
So cryptic indeed is her conduct
(both for us and her friends) that it is
arranged that her choice between the
two men shall be decided by the test
of a dream. In consequence, however,
of an attack of insomnia this dream (like
the duel) fails to come off and shortly
after midnight her waking doubts are
resolved in her husband's favour.</p>

<p>It will be seen that, the stuff of Mr.
<span class="sc">Jerome's</span> play is sufficiently fatuous;
but Mr. <span class="sc">Edmund Maurice</span> as <i>The
Colonel</i> was always amusing, and in
the multitude of counsellors there was
merriment. Unfortunately Mr. <span class="sc">Stanley
Cooke</span>, as a <i>Herr Professor</i> and leader of

<p>The farce was varied by a very amateur
romance as between a young
American and the niece of an hotel-keeper;
also by a slab of melodrama
(dealing with the girl's parentage)
which only escaped from pure banality
by the too brief glimpse it gave us of
that admirable actress, Miss <span class="sc">Ruth
Mackay</span>.</p>

<p>The scene (perhaps the best part of
the whole show) was laid in "An
Ancient Grove" adjacent to a German
University. (The catalogue, peculiarly
reticent about proper names, offers
my memory no refreshment.) This
"Ancient Grove," unchanged throughout
the play, served a number of useful
purposes. It made excuse for the
intermittent apparition (otherwise inexplicable)
of a little woodland figure
that played upon a pipe. Its proximity
to an hotel afforded occasion for meal
after meal <i>en plein air</i>. Its proximity
to a University Town encouraged the
frequent passage of German students,
vivacious and vocal; also the convenient
appearance of any foreign resident or
visitor at a moment's notice. Its
Statue of Venus (fully draped) afforded
an authentic incitement to the making of
love. Its environs enabled Mr. <span class="sc">Jerome</span>
to dispose of his puppets whenever their
presence became undesirable. They
simply said, "Let us stroll in the woods;"
or "Come for a walk with me," and
he was rid of them. Finally the
"Ancient Grove" contained a central
patch of boscage in whose cover one of
the duellists, arriving on the <i>terrain</i> a
little before the time, remained <i>perdu</i> in
slumber, undisturbed by a loud conversation
carried on within a few feet of
him by all the other parties to the
combat.</p>

<p>Indeed the scenery put in some good
work, and I really don't know
what we should have done
without it.</p>

<p><i>The Great Gamble</i> was, of
course, the lottery of marriage.
But for some of us it meant
the risk we ran in attending
the first night of a play by
Mr. <span class="sc">Jerome</span> after our bitter
experience of his <i>Rowena in
Search of a Father</i>. To say
that his present work is an
improvement upon his last
would be to damn it with a
fainter praise than it deserves.
<i>The Great Gamble</i>
is a strange and inscrutable
medley, but it has its exhilarating
moments, and the
humour of its dialogue,
though it is mitigated by
the Professor's contributions,
is worthy of a much better
design.</p>

<h2>VERY MUCH GREATER LONDON.</h2>

<h3>[<i>One result of the introduction of the
Bachelet flying train should certainly
be the extension of London's suburbs.
We extract the following from a season-ticket
holder's diary of the near future.</i>]</h3>

<p><i>Dundee.</i>&mdash;Strap-hung again to-day;
London train abominably crowded.
That is the worst of living in these
inner suburbs. Men who live on the
other side of the Orkney Tunnel tell
me the train only begins seriously to
fill up at Caithness; before that, one
has reasonable hope of a seat. Brown,
for instance, says that, coming up from
Kirkwall and entering train before
pressure begins, he rarely has to use
strap. Don't know how the poor
wretches at Newcastle and Durham
ever get to town at all, though, living
so close to King's Cross, they can perhaps
afford to stand for the few minutes
they are in train....</p>

<p>No change for better, so have been
studying agents' lists; some items attractive.
For example:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Belgian Tunnel Line.</i>&mdash;Antwerp and
Liverpool Street in 29 minutes; low
season-ticket rates; excellent mid-day
service, enabling business men to take
luncheon at home.</p>

<p><i>Charming Maisonettes</i> in fine healthy
suburb, S.W. London (Penzance district);
bath h. and c.; Company's water;
two minutes Bachelet Railway-station;
25 minutes Paddington and City.</p>

<p><i>Sunny Cairo, S.E.</i>&mdash;Nice self-contained
flats; charming desert view;
low rents; ninety-five minutes Charing
Cross; five minutes Sahara golf links
(inland course but real sand bunkers).</p>

<p><i>Week-End Cottage for Harassed City
Worker, Siberia (near London</i>).&mdash;To be
let furnished; bracing air; perfect
quiet.</p>

<hr />

<h2>SYNTHETIC MUTTON.</h2>

<p>In view of the impending scarcity
of meat, so vividly foreshadowed in a
recent article in <i>The Times</i>, it is most
reassuring to learn that a new comestible,
palatable and nutritious, yet entirely
free from the drawbacks of all
flesh foods, has been invented by a
German scientist and will shortly be
put upon the market at a price which
will bring it within the reach of the
humblest household.</p>

<p>Professor Schafskopf, the inventor,
has long been engaged on experiments
with a view to the production of synthetic
mutton, and his diligent efforts
have now been crowned with success.
The basis of the new food is compressed
peat, which is so permeated with a
variety of nutritive juices, applied at
high pressure by a grouting machine,
as to be practically indistinguishable
from the best Southdown mutton.</p>

<p>By way of putting his discovery to
the test Professor Schafskopf entertained
a number of distinguished guests
at the Fitz Hotel last week, and
with hardly an exception they were
astonished at the succulent and sumptuous
flavour of the new food, which
is called by the attractive name of
"Supermut."</p>

<p>Professor Bino Byles, interviewed at
the close of the banquet, said that
"Supermut" was a distinct success. It
had all the digestibility of tripe with
an added aroma of Harris Tweed.</p>

<p>Mr. Gullick, the famous motorist,
said that "Supermut" reminded him
of the best cormorant. He believed
that it could also be used for making
unpuncturable tyres.</p>

<p>Lord Findhorn, the eminent Scots
Judge, said that "Supermut" had converted
him to carnivorous food, though
he was an hereditary vegetarian.</p>

<p>Finally we note that <i>The Forceps</i> in
a laudatory article pays a handsome
tribute to the new food, and says, "It
must be conceded that a very reliable
substitute for mutton has at length
been produced. We found it hard to
distinguish it from a saddle."</p>

<p>That this is a day to be bright and hearty,</p>
<p>And to take our lunch as a picnic party&mdash;</p>
<p>To take our lunch with toil and care</p>
<p>Away from home in the open air.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Now I maintain that it can't be right,</p>

<h2>THE CORNCRAKE.</h2>

<p>The corncrake has arrived. As I
turned in at the gate last night he
reported himself in the usual way. So
now we are in for it. The priceless
boon of silence in the hours of darkness
will be denied to us for many weeks to
come.</p>

<p>I do not know how to describe his
utterance. It could not without extravagance
be called a note, still less a
chirp, and least of all a song. It is not
a bark&mdash;not quite. It is hardly a growl
or a grunt or a snort; I should be sorry
to call it a bray or a yelp. And yet I
am not going to admit that it is a
quack or a bleat; and it isn't a screech
or a squeal or a sob. Nor is it a croak,
though now we are getting nearer to it.
The puzzling thing about it is that it
was clearly meant by Nature to be an
interjection. Uttered once, suddenly,
from the far side of a hedge it would
admirably convey such a sentiment as,
"Hi!" "What ho!" or "Here we are
again!" But in practice it is the one
sound in the whole landscape that
never interjects. It is a monument of
barren reiteration.</p>

<p>I wonder why he does it. No doubt
he has some end in view. He must get
something out of it&mdash;some bodily ease
or mental stimulus or spiritual consolation.
But he must surely have been
born with a prodigious passion for
monotony. It may surprise you to
learn that in the course of the season
he will make that same remark over
two million times. I have worked it
out. Two million is a conservative
estimate. It only allows for eight
hours' work out of the twenty-four, for
a term of six weeks: so that it is well
within the mark.</p>

<p>Our corncrake&mdash;I don't know what
the usual standard may be&mdash;does ninety-eight
to the minute. He is as regular
as the ticking of a clock. You can't
hustle him and you can't wear him out.
At times when I have thought he
might be getting tired and thirsty I
have imagined that he was slowing
down; but he never gets below ninety-six;
and in his most active and feverish
moments he very rarely touches the
hundred. At short measured intervals
he punctuates the night with his dry
delivery, unhasting yet unresting, his
sole idea to get his forty-seven-thousand
up without a break before the morning.
He just doesn't know the meaning of
the word emphasis; he has absolutely
no sense of rhythm. Once I tried to
believe that he was talking in three-four
time, or at least that he was occasionally
accenting a note. But he never
does. He gets no louder or softer,
higher or lower, quicker or slower&mdash;he
just keeps on.</p>

<p>You need not suppose that I have
meekly sat down under this thing.
This is his sixth year, and I have
been at war with him all the time.
But finally he holds the field, and my
only hope now is that his powers may
begin to fail as old age creeps on. Even
if he dropped to eighty a minute it
would be an intense relief. But I dare
say he means to bequeath the pitch to
a successor at his death&mdash;perhaps to a
relative.</p>

<p>At first I used to throw things at
him out of the bedroom window&mdash;hairbrushes
and slippers and books and all
sorts of odds and ends. I had to go
round with a basket after breakfast
collecting them. But it was no good;
he never dropped a beat. Then I deliberately
devastated the garden, with
a view to deprive him of cover. I had
all the bushes taken up and the flowerbeds
removed, and I laid down, just
under my bedroom window, a wide
expanse of tar-macadam, as bald and
flat as a mirror&mdash;a beetle couldn't have
hidden himself on it. (I had to call
this a hard tennis-court for the sake of
appearances. We do as a matter of
fact play on it sometimes.) But it
had no effect on the corncrake. Of
course the truth is that I never have
the least idea where he is; no one has.
No one has over seen him or ever will.
He is endowed with great ventriloquial
powers. That is a provision of Nature,
and if you will reflect a moment you
will see that it must be so. For,
granted that he is to go on talking like
that, if he could not throw his voice
about from place to place and thus
make it impossible to get at him, the
species would become extinct.</p>

<p>There is nothing more that I can do,
and it is only fair to admit that the
whole thing is my own fault. When I
built my house six years ago I might
have shown a little common foresight
in this matter. I got everything else
right as far as I could. My rooms are
well placed for sunshine and they have
the best of the view. The water-supply
is good; there is plenty of fall for the
drainage system; we are well out of
the motor dust. But I omitted one
precaution. I should have had the
ground surveyed for corncrakes.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<h3>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerics.</i>)</h3>

<p>In <i>The World Set Free</i> (<span class="sc">Macmillan</span>) Mr. <span class="sc">H. G. Wells</span> has
seen a vision&mdash;the vision of a world plunged into blazing and
crumbling chaos by the ultimate logical issues of military
violence. Defence, becoming always less and less effective
against attack, which is always more and more a matter of
the laboratory, finally succumbs before <i>Holsten's</i> discovery
of "Carolinum" and its final disastrous application in the
"atomic bombs." Romancing on a theme out of <span class="sc">Soddy's</span>
<i>Interpretation of Radium</i>, Mr. <span class="sc">Wells</span>, with those deft
strokes of allusive and imaginative realism&mdash;so convincing
is he that realism is the only apt word for his daring constructions
of the future&mdash;depicts the shattering of the
headquarters of the War Control in Paris, followed by a
swift counterstroke against the Central European Control
in Berlin by the aviation corps, the destruction of capital
after capital, and the final great battle in the air, with the
bombing of the Dutch sea walls. Thereafter comes the
attempt at reconstruction by the Council of Brissago, a
convention of the governing folk of the world&mdash;the dream
and deed of the Frenchman <i>Leblanc</i>, "a little bald,
spectacled man," a peacemonger whom, till that day of
ruin, everyone had thought an amiable fool. One monarch,
"The Slavic Fox," sees in the assembly a chance to strike
for world sovereignty, and the failure of his bomb-fraught
planes and his final undoing in the secret arsenal are
breathless pieces of description.</p>

<p>A subject for wonder is the astonishing advance in the
author's technique. <i>The World Set Free</i> is on an altogether
different plane from <i>The War of the Worlds</i> and those other
gorgeous pot-boilers. It combines the alert philosophy and
adroit criticism of the <i>Tono Bungay</i> phase with the luminous
vision of <i>Anticipations</i> and the romantic interest of his
eccentric books of adventure. The seer in Mr. <span class="sc">Wells</span>
comes uppermost, and I almost think that when the history
of the latter half of the twentieth century comes to be
written it will be found not merely that he has prophesied
surely, but that his visions have actually tended to shape
the course of events. Short of <i>Holsten's</i> "atomic bombs"
(which may or may not be developed) Mr. <span class="sc">Wells</span> makes a
fair foreshadowing of the uprush of subliminal sanity which
may very well be timed to appear before 1999. I can't
take my hat off to Mr. <span class="sc">Wells</span> because I've had it in my
hand out of respect for him these last few years. So I touch
my forelock.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Roding Rectory</i> (<span class="sc">Stanley Paul</span>) is in many respects the
best novel Mr. <span class="sc">Archibald Marshall</span> has written. Those
who remember <i>Exton Manor</i> and the three books dealing
with the lives and deeds of the <i>Clintons</i> will consider this
to be high praise, as, indeed, it is meant to be. Mr.
<span class="sc">Marshall</span> preserves the ease and amenity of style which
we have learnt to expect of him; he creates his characters&mdash;ordinary
English men and women, animated by ordinary
English motives&mdash;with all his old skill, and he sets them to
work out their destinies in that pleasant atmosphere of
English country life which no one since <span class="sc">Trollope's</span> death
has reproduced with greater truth and delicacy than Mr.
<span class="sc">Marshall</span>. This time, however, the clash of temperaments
and traditions is more severe, the story cuts deeper into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page420" id="page420"></a>[pg 420]</span>
humanity, and the narration of it is, I think, more closely
knit. The Rector of Roding, the <i>Rev. Henry French</i>, is a
fine figure of a man honourably devoted to the duties of his
parish and abounding in good works. It is sad to see him
cast down from his pride of place by the sudden revelation
of an ill deed done in his thoughtless youth at Oxford. In
an interview managed with an admirable sense of dramatic
fitness he is faced by a son, the living embodiment of his
all-but-forgotten sin, and soon the whole parish knows of it.
But the Rector, with the aid of his wife, fights his fight and
in the end wins back his self-respect and the respect of his
neighbours. He is helped, too, by <i>Dr. Merrow</i>, the Congregational
minister, a beautiful character drawn with deep
sympathy. Indeed, it is <i>Dr. Merrow</i> who has the <i>beau r&ocirc;le</i>,
and, I must add, deserves it. For the rest I must let Mr.
<span class="sc">Marshall's</span> book speak for itself. He has written a very
powerful and interesting story.</p>

<hr />

<p>Among reviewers of books
there is a convention by
which the matter of a first
edition&mdash;whether a single
story or a collection of
stories&mdash;which has been reproduced
from a magazine
or magazines, is treated as
if it were a novelty. It is
a sound and benevolent convention,
because the stuff of
magazines only receives at
best a very sketchy notice.
Miss <span class="sc">May Sinclair</span>, however,
is apparently prepared;
to risk the loss of any
advantage to be derived
from it, for her collection
of short and middle-sized
stones republished under
the title of the first of
them, <i>The Judgment of Eve</i>
(<span class="sc">Hutchinson</span>), is prefaced
by an article in which she
replies to those critics who
took notice of some of them
at the time of their appearance
in magazine form. By
this recognition of judgment already passed she sets me
free to regard her stories as old matter, and to confine
myself to a review of her introduction. In this answer to
her critics I cannot feel that she has been well advised.
Even in a second edition critics are best left alone, unless
the author can correct them on a point of fact or interpretation
of fact. Here it is on a matter of opinion that
she joins issue with them. They seem (the misguided ones)
to have rashly said that "The Judgment of Eve" was "a
novel boiled down," and that "The Wrackham Memoirs,"
on the other hand, was "a short story spun out." But
Miss <span class="sc">Sinclair</span> is very sure that she knew what she was
about. She can "lay her hand on her heart and swear
that 'The Judgment of Eve' would have lost by any words
that could conceivably have been added to it;" she is certain
that "Charles Wrackham required the precise amount
of room that has been given him." I dare say she is right,
but I wish she could have left someone else to say so. For
myself I should have thought it obvious that a story dealing
with character and its development by circumstance demanded
more room in which to spread itself than one that
dealt with a situation, dramatic or psychologic; yet "The
Wrackham Memoirs," which, whatever its complexity,
belongs to the latter type, takes up very nearly as much
space as "The Judgment of Eve," which belongs to the
former. Of course no critic of even moderate intelligence
would propose to fix a limit of length for every type of
story, but it may safely be said that, if you take <span class="sc">Maupassant</span>
for a standard, the best short stories have concerned themselves
with situation rather than with character; and,
though I have not had the privilege of reading the
criticisms which are the subject of Miss <span class="sc">Sinclair's</span> rebuke,
I can easily believe that they were governed by this
elementary reflection. It must have occurred to Miss
<span class="sc">Sinclair</span> herself, even if she did not find it convenient to
take cognisance of it in her reply. Perhaps she will have
something to say on this subject in some future edition of
her very interesting book, and I should indeed be flattered
if she would consent, in a brief phrase or two, to review my
review of her review of her reviewers.</p>

<p>Good costume novels are
not so common nowadays
that I can pass <i>Desmond
O'Connor</i> (<span class="sc">Long</span>) without a
most hearty welcome. For
it is an excellent example
of its class&mdash;full of rescues,
of swashbuckling and of
midnight escapes; with a
gallant hero (and Irish at
that), a lovely heroine, two
bold bad villains and a
sufficiency of kings and
other historical celebrities
to fill the background picturesquely.
In fact Mr.
<span class="sc">George H. Jessop</span> has seen
to it that no ingredient
proper to this kind of dish
shall be wanting, and I have
great pleasure in congratulating
him upon the result.
<i>Desmond</i> was a soldier of fortune,
a captain in the gallant
Irish Brigade that served
<span class="sc">King Louis XIV.</span> against
the Allies. During the siege
of Bruges the young captain
chanced to see one morning at mass the fair <i>Margaret,
Countess of Anhalt</i>. She had lately fled to the town to
frustrate the intentions of <i>Louis</i>, who would have given
her hand to an equally unwilling suitor. There was also,
hanging about, a certain <i>De Brissac</i>, who in the event of
the countess's death or imprisonment would succeed to her
estates. So off we go, cut and thrust, sword, cloak and
rapier, all to the right jingle of tushery, till the last chapter,
in which <i>King Louis</i> relents and does what kings (of France
especially) always do in the last chapters of historical
romances. Really it seems sometimes as though the Louvre
under the Monarchy must have been run as a kind of
superior matrimonial agency in a large way of business.
Anyhow he rings down the curtain upon a bustling tale
that should add to the reputation of its author.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
